This directory contains a short lesson plan for a ~3 hour workshop on D3.js  The lesson assumes prior knowledge of html, css, and basic programming.  Students without prior experience, however, should still be able to follow along with the lesson and see how
D3 code is interpreted in the web browser, they just may not understand why as well as a student who understands programming fundamentals.

The lesson will start with a brief powerpoint introducing the subject matter.  It will explain what d3.js is, give several examples of 
visualizations made using d3.js, and then give a brief overview of web browser development tools.  The lesson will then
jump straight into coding in d3.js with 3 different parts:

1. Covers simple selecting, appending svgs, and making transitions
2. Covers binding data svg elements
3. Covers the histogram layout and mouseover functions.
4. Covers importing geospatial data and using topojson to create maps
	part4 requires the following dependencies
	-libgdal1-dev
	-ogr2ogr
	-topjson
	-http-server

Each part is punctuated with questions and sessions for students to create their own visualizations based on the lesson.

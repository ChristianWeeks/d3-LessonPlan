This directory contains a short lesson plan for a ~3 hour workshop on D3.js  The lesson assumes prior knowledge of html, css, and basic programming.  Students without prior experience, however, should still be able to follow along with the lesson and see how
D3 code is interpreted in the web browser, they just may not understand why as well as a student who understands programming fundamentals.

The lesson will start with a brief powerpoint introducing the subject matter.  It will explain what d3.js is, give several examples of 
visualizations made using d3.js, and then give a brief overview of web browser development tools.  The lesson will then
jump straight into coding in d3.js with 3 different parts:

1. Covers simple selecting, appending svgs, and making transitions
2. Covers binding data svg elements
3. Covers the histogram layout and mouseover functions.
4. Covers importing geospatial data and using topojson to create maps
	part4 requires the following dependencies
	-libgdal1-dev
	-ogr2ogr
	-topojson
	-http-server

Parts 1 - 3 require no set up and and will work simply by copying the code in the solutions into the blank templates.  Part 4, however, takes several steps:
1. User must download shape files (.shp) from naturalearthdata.com into VectorFiles.
2. User must run GIStoJSON.sh, a bash script that converts the vector data from the shape files and places them in .json format so D3 can read and manipulate them.  This script requires libgdal, ogr2ogr, and topojson.
3. User must start up a web server using http-server.  Simply type (http-server -p 8008 &) in directory of the files and then go to that address in the web browser.  This step is required to properly import .json files.

Each part is punctuated with questions and sessions for students to create their own visualizations based on the lesson.
